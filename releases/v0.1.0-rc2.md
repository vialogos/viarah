# Release v0.1.0-rc2

## Overview
- Second release candidate for ViaRah.
- Covers changes since `v0.1.0-rc1`.

## Highlights
- Platform roles across org-scoped APIs (admin/pm can operate without pre-seeded org memberships).
- Invites now support explicit delivery mode (`delivery=link|email`) with correct environment links.
- Work item time estimates (`estimate_minutes`) added for tasks/subtasks and surfaced in Work detail.
- Workflow reassignment/migration tooling (`manage.py migrate_project_workflow`) to avoid orphaning work.
- Branding refresh (Via Logos favicon/masthead + subtle footer logo link).

## Operator notes
- Apply migrations after pulling: `docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate`
- For local dev with multiple stacks:
  - Override backend bind port via Compose `WEB_PORT`.
  - Point Vite proxy at the backend via `VITE_BACKEND_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`).

## Changes
- Fixed: `/api/me` no longer returns `403` for valid API keys when the key owner lacks an `OrgMembership` for the API key’s `org_id`.
- Added: Work item time estimates (`estimate_minutes`) for tasks/subtasks (API + UI).
- Changed: Invites support `delivery=link|email` (link mode never attempts email; responses include `full_invite_url` + `email_sent`).
- Fixed: Work detail assignee no longer renders as “Select a value” when a value is selected.
- Added: `manage.py migrate_project_workflow` to migrate/clear workflow stage assignments safely.
- Changed: Branding updates (Via Logos favicon/masthead + footer logo link).
